Consider the statement below.
The nodes in a decomposition tree (the fields through which the metric is analyzed by in the visuals) are fixed and can‘t be modified by the end-users viewing the report.
•	 A. True
•	 B. False
By default, the nodes can be added or removed by the end-users to customize their data exploration. But if needed, you can lock the nodes by clicking on the padlock icon available next to the title. AI splits are also flexible in the context. For example, if you cross filter the decomposition tree visual with another one, it will provide the lowest/highest node in that context being filtered. You can choose the lightbulb icon in the visual for reverting it back to a non-AI node and it will lose this context sensitivity.

You want to calculate/ return the last day of the month in the BS data to make sure that the BS data can be related to the Date table. Which of the following type of calculations would you use?
•	 A. A DAX calculated column
•	 B. A DAX calculated measure
•	 C. An M custom column
•	 D. None of the above
•	Calculated column: A calculated column is added to an existing table and creates a new column based on existing columns in the same table. This is ideal for creating a new column that directly relates to the existing BS data.
•	Direct relation: By creating a calculated column in the BS data table, you can directly link the last day of the month to the BS data, ensuring a strong connection with the Date table.
•	Efficiency: Using a calculated column is generally more efficient than other methods, as the calculation is performed only once when the data is refreshed.
While a DAX calculated measure could be used to calculate the last day of the month for a specific context, a calculated column provides a more direct and efficient way to relate the BS data to the Date table.

20. Question
For your Power BI dashboard, you have just created a pie chart visualizing the actual sales figures by region for the last year. In order to give decision makers a deeper insight, you want to extend the visual with a breakdown by countries. You decide to use the small multiples feature as a comfortable way of exploding visuals by a given dimension.
Is it a feasible solution?
•	 A. Yes
•	 B. No
Option A is incorrect because the small multiples option is currently available for bar, column, area and line visuals, only.
Option B is CORRECT because enhancing the pie chart visual with small multiples is currently not supported in Power BI.
21. Question
You have just created a bar chart visualizing the actual sales figures by region for the past years. In order to give decision makers a deeper insight, you want to extend the visual with a breakdown by countries using the small visuals feature, and you also want to enhance it by showing the trend lines.
Is it a feasible way of solving the problem?
•	 A. Yes because all the formatting options available for visuals also work for small multiples
•	 B. No because adding trend lines to small multiples charts is currently not available
•	 C. Yes because while many formatting options doesnt work for small multiples, trend lines can be applied with no limitation
•	 D. No because bar charts cannot be broken down into small multiples
While you can generally create small multiples from bar charts to break down data by country, directly adding trend lines to each individual small multiple is not currently a standard feature in most data visualization tools.
•	Small Multiples: These effectively create multiple, smaller versions of the main chart, each focusing on a specific subset of the data (in this case, each country within a region).
•	Trend Lines: These are lines that show the general direction and rate of change of a dataset over time.
Limitations:
•	Tool-Dependent: The specific capabilities of your visualization software will determine if you can directly add trend lines to each small multiple. Some tools might offer workarounds or extensions to achieve this.
•	Visual Complexity: Adding trend lines to many small multiples can sometimes make the visualization overly complex and difficult to interpret, especially if the number of countries within each region is large.
Possible Workarounds:
•	Separate Trend Lines: You could create a separate line chart for each country to visualize trends alongside the original bar chart.
•	Conditional Formatting: Some tools might allow you to apply conditional formatting to the bars in each small multiple to visually highlight trends (e.g., color-coding bars based on whether sales are increasing or decreasing).
In summary: While the concept of breaking down a bar chart into small multiples and adding trend lines is generally sound, direct implementation might be limited by the capabilities of your visualization software.
22. Question
You are creating a dashboard by using the Power BI service. You have an existing report page that contains three charts. You need to add the charts to the dashboard while maintaining the interactivity between the charts. What should you do?
•	 A. Edit interactions in the report and set all interactions to Filter.
•	 B. Pin each chart as a tile.
•	 C. Edit the dashboard theme and pin each chart as a tile.
•	 D. Pin the report page as a live tile.
•	
•	**Reason on that page. When you interact with a chart on the dashboard, the changes will be reflected in all the charts on the pinned report page.
•	Pinning the entire report page as a live tile is an effective way to maintain interactivity between charts on a dashboard. When you pin an entire report page, it retains its interactive features, allowing users to interact with the visualizations just as they would in the original report. This means that filtering and cross-highlighting will work seamlessly across all visuals on that page.
Incorrect Options:
•	A. Edit interactions in the report and set all interactions to Filter:
•	This approach would create cross-filtering between the charts on the report page, but it wouldn’t necessarily maintain the same level of interactivity as pinning the entire page.
•	 While editing interactions in the report allows you to control how visuals interact with one another (e.g., filtering, highlighting), this step is not directly related to adding visuals to a dashboard. Interactions are configured within the report itself and do not carry over when you pin visuals to a dashboard. Therefore, this option does not address the requirement of adding charts to a dashboard while maintaining interactivity.
•	B. Pin each chart as a tile:
•	Pinning individual charts separately would break the existing interactivity between them on the report page. Each pinned chart would become an independent tile on the dashboard.
•	 Pinning each chart as a tile is a valid method for adding visuals to a dashboard. However, when you pin individual charts, they do not maintain the same level of interactivity that exists in the report. The tiles on the dashboard serve as static representations of the charts and do not allow for cross-filtering or interactions between them as they would in the original report. Thus, while this option is technically correct for adding tiles, it does not fulfill the requirement of maintaining interactivity.
•	C. Edit the dashboard theme and pin each chart as a tile:
•	Changing the dashboard theme doesn’t affect the interactivity between charts. Pinning individual charts would still break the existing interactivity.
•	This option suggests editing the dashboard theme before pinning charts as tiles. While you can customize the theme of a dashboard, this action does not contribute to maintaining interactivity between charts. Similar to option B, pinning charts as tiles will not preserve their interactive features from the report. Therefore, this option does not effectively address the requirement.
23. Question
You need to create a data model that includes multiple tables. Which tool should you use?
•	 Power BI
•	 Power Automate
•	 Power Apps
•	 Power Query
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, transform and clean the data, and create relationships between tables. Power BI also provides a data modeling feature that allows users to create a data model with multiple tables and define relationships between them. Therefore, Power BI is the most suitable tool for creating a data model with multiple tables. Power Automate, Power Apps, and Power Query are also part of the Power Platform by Microsoft, but they are not specifically designed for creating data models with multiple tables. Power Automate (formerly known as Microsoft Flow) is a cloud-based service that allows users to create automated workflows between different applications and services. It is used for automating repetitive tasks and integrating different systems. Power Apps is a low-code platform that allows users to create custom business applications without writing code. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for building user interfaces and connecting to data sources. Power Query is a data transformation and cleansing tool that is used to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from different sources. It is a part of Microsoft Excel and Power BI, and it allows users to clean and transform data before loading it into a data model. However, it is not specifically designed for creating data models with multiple tables.“

By setting the data category to geographic, Power BI will be able to recognize the data as such and use it to display location-based information. D. Use the columns of the geography data type in all visuals: This action is necessary to ensure that the location-based data is used in all visuals. By using the columns of the geography data type in all visuals, the report will be able to display location-based information in a consistent and meaningful way. A. From Power Query Editor, detect the data types of the relevant columns: This action is not necessary for configuring the report to display data based on each user‘s location. Detecting the data types of the relevant columns is useful for data cleaning and transformation, but it does not directly relate to location-based data. C. Create a hierarchy for columns of the geography data type: This action is not necessary for configuring the report to display data based on each user‘s location. Creating a hierarchy for columns of the geography data type is useful for organizing and displaying data in a hierarchical manner, but it does not directly relate to location-based data.“

What is the difference between a shared and a personal workspace in Power BI?
•	 Shared workspaces can be accessed by multiple users
•	 Personal workspaces can only be accessed by the owner
•	 Shared workspaces can be edited by multiple users
•	 Personal workspaces can be shared with other users
•	Explanation:
•	A. Shared workspaces can be accessed by multiple users. This is correct. Shared workspaces are designed to be collaborative and can be accessed by multiple users within an organization. This allows for teamwork and shared insights.
•	B. Personal workspaces can only be accessed by the owner. This is correct. Personal workspaces are private and can only be accessed by the user who created them. This provides a secure environment for personal work and experimentation.
•	C. Shared workspaces can be edited by multiple users. This is correct. Shared workspaces allow multiple users to edit and modify reports and dashboards. This enables collaborative development and ensures that everyone is working on the same version.
•	D. Personal workspaces can be shared with other users. This is incorrect. Personal workspaces are private and cannot be shared with other users. This is to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the data and work contained within the workspace.
•	In summary, the key difference between shared and personal workspaces in Power BI is that shared workspaces are designed for collaboration and can be accessed and edited by multiple users, while personal workspaces are private and can only be accessed by the owner.
27. Question
How can you manage permissions for a workspace in Power BI?
•	 Add or remove members
•	 Assign roles to members
•	 Set permissions for specific reports
•	 Delete a workspace

“All of the propositions are correct, but the most suitable or efficient proposition for managing permissions for a workspace in Power BI is to assign roles to members. Explanation: 1. Add or remove members: This proposition is correct because adding or removing members is a basic step in managing permissions for a workspace. However, it does not provide a granular level of control over what each member can do within the workspace. 2. Assign roles to members: This proposition is the most suitable or efficient because it allows you to assign specific roles to members, such as Admin, Member, or Contributor. Each role has a different level of permissions, which gives you more control over what each member can do within the workspace. 3. Set permissions for specific reports: This proposition is correct, but it is more focused on managing permissions for individual reports within a workspace, rather than managing permissions for the workspace as a whole. 4. Delete a workspace: This proposition is also correct, but it is not related to managing permissions for a workspace. Deleting a workspace is a separate action that should be taken only if you no longer need the workspace.“
28. Question
What is the purpose of the Power BI Gateway?
•	 To allow users to connect to on-premises data sources
•	 To allow users to create custom visuals
•	 To allow users to share reports with others
•	 To allow users to create dashboards
“Proposition: To allow users to connect to on-premises data sources. Explanation: The Power BI Gateway is a tool that allows users to connect to on-premises data sources, such as databases or files, and securely transfer that data to the cloud-based Power BI service. This enables users to create reports and dashboards based on data that is stored locally, without having to manually upload or transfer the data to the cloud. The other propositions listed are not the primary purpose of the Power BI Gateway. While users can create custom visuals and share reports with others using Power BI, these features do not require the use of the Gateway. Similarly, while the Gateway can be used in conjunction with dashboards, its primary purpose is to enable data connectivity.“
29. Question
What is the purpose of the Power BI data model?
•	 To provide a visual representation of data
•	 To store data in a centralized location
•	 To create reports and dashboards
•	 To analyze data using DAX formulas

•	To provide a visual representation of data: This is the purpose of visualizations like charts and graphs, not the data model itself.
•	To create reports and dashboards: While the data model is essential for creating reports and dashboards, its primary purpose is to store and organize data.
•	To analyze data using DAX formulas: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a language used to create measures and calculations within the Power BI data model. However, the data model itself is the foundation for these calculations.
Therefore, the correct answer is To store data in a centralized location.

Dataverse is a cloud-based data platform that allows you to securely store and manage data used by business applications. Since the app is fully hosted in Microsoft Teams, it makes sense to select the Dataverse connector to connect to the app‘s data source. Option A, Microsoft Teams Personal Analytics, is not the correct connector for this situation as it is used to analyze personal productivity data within Microsoft Teams, not to connect to a custom app‘s data source. Option B, SQL Server database, is not the correct connector for this situation as it is used to connect to a SQL Server database, which is not the data source for the project management app. Option D, Dataflows, is not the correct connector for this situation as it is used to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a data warehouse or data lake, which is not necessary for connecting to the project management app‘s data source.“
31. Question
You have four sales regions. Each region has multiple sales managers.You implement row-level security (RLS) in a data model. You assign the relevant mail-enabled security group to each role.You have sales reports that enable analysis by region. The sales managers can view the sales records of their region. The sales managers are prevented from viewing records from other regions.A sales manager changes to a different region.You need to ensure that the sales manager can see the correct sales data.What should you do?
•	 A. Change the Microsoft Power BI license type of the sales manager.
•	 B. From Microsoft Power BI Desktop, edit the Row-Level Security setting for the reports.
•	 C. Manage the permissions of the underlying dataset.
•	 D. Request that the sales manager be added to the correct Azure Active Directory group.
“D. Request that the sales manager be added to the correct Azure Active Directory group. Explanation: Since the sales manager has changed to a different region, their access to the sales data needs to be updated accordingly. The most efficient way to do this is to request that the sales manager be added to the correct Azure Active Directory group, which is assigned to the relevant role in the data model. This will ensure that the sales manager has access to the correct sales data based on their new region. Option A, changing the Microsoft Power BI license type of the sales manager, is not relevant to the situation as it does not address the issue of updating the sales manager‘s access to the correct sales data. Option B, editing the Row-Level Security setting for the reports from Microsoft Power BI Desktop, is also not the most efficient solution as it would require manual updates to the RLS settings for each report. It is better to update the sales manager‘s access at the role level in the data model. Option C, managing the permissions of the underlying dataset, is not the best solution as it would require updating the permissions for each dataset individually. It is better to update the sales manager‘s access at the role level in the data model. Therefore, option D is the correct and most efficient solution.“
